# So either we have results or moonsun_miner exited with error, so we can be  a bit lazy and not bother to check
# the response before processing!!
# (I know this is very bad program design, but I intend to properly module-ise moonsun_miner in the near future,
#  to a class-based design, which will make this issue irrelevant!)


# Lets loop through the results, and spit them out to a CSV
# Unfortunately, because the fields are 'multivalued' in Solr, the actual data always comes as a list even though
# all the actual data fields only have one entry.
# We can fix that in two ways:
# a) Loop through the results, and reduce the one-item lists to strings
# b) Use the equivalent _sortable fields in Solr for the query
#
# I am tending towards solution a here, because the _sortable fields may well have been modified by the Solr routines
# that prepare text to be searchable (i.e you might get "Bronte" where the original data says "BrontÃ«")

# Here is a routine implementing solution a
